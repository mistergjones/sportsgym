                    Our gym creche has been operating for 30 years and has
                    helped raise the children of hundreds of our members over
                    the years. If it wasn’t for them, many parents would have
                    struggled to find the fitness balance they crave. We have
                    weekly themes designed to keep the children educated and
                    occupied, art and craft, creative play, story time and
                    oodles of education and imagination from our creche team.{" "}

                <p>
                    “I love the creche team! But more importantly so do my kids.
                    My eldest (5) looks forward to school holidays as she misses
                    them. My youngest (2) drags me in the centre to the creche
                    door. I love the peace of mind I get, being able to spend
                    time on myself knowing my babies are happy and safe.”{" "}

                <p>
                    “I have had 3 of my child come through the creche now, and I
                    can honestly say the ladies there have become our second
                    family. I can trust them to look after my kids as if they
                    were their own. Their beautiful smiles in the morning is
                    something I’ve truly come to love.”

                    “Can I just mention how BEAUTIFUL the child care ladies are.
                    This has been the first time i’ve let my 6m/o daughter in
                    the care of someone else let alone child care and I’m bloody
                    impressed. Being comfortable with that helps me attend the
                    morning classes.”

                    “My daughter (2) and I both love coming to the gym. The
                    creche ladies are very experienced and clearly love kids,
                    which gives me huge peace of mind while I focus on my
                    health. One of the best decisions I’ve ever made.”

                    “Thank you for being such amazing thoughtful caregivers for
                    my baby girl. She is a lockdown baby and has learnt to
                    adjust to being in the care of others very well by being in
                    your care. One hour to myself and an hour running around for
                    my baby in creche makes our day. Thank you!”

                    my kids are so happy and comfortable there. It’s easy to get
                    out of bed to workout when I know they will be entertained.”
